# Machine-Learning-Projects

-------------------

This repository holds the codes for my group projects for the class "Applied Machine learning" taught by Andreas Mueller at Columbia University. You can find details about this class on this link:https://amueller.github.io/applied_ml_spring_2017/.

### Projects:

+ #### Bank Direct Marketing Campaign Prediction:
   * Predicted whether a promotion call will result in a subscription by given the customerâ€™s information and call history.


   * models:
      *  **non-tree** based models: 
      
          SVM
          
          Logistic Regression
          
          KNN
      
      *  **tree** based models: 
          
          decision tree
          
          random forest
          
          gradient boosting
      
      *  **ensemble** modeling: 
          
          Voting Classifier (Gradient Boosting + Logistic Regression)
