# Machine-Learning-Projects

-------------------

This repository holds the codes for my group projects for the class "Applied Machine learning" taught by Andreas Mueller at Columbia University. You can find details about this class on this link:https://amueller.github.io/applied_ml_spring_2017/.

### Projects:

+ #### Bank Direct Marketing Campaign Prediction:
   * Predict whether a promotion call will result in a subscription by given the customerâ€™s information and call history.


   * models:
      *  **non-tree** based models: 
      
          SVM
          
          Logistic Regression
          
          KNN
      
      *  **tree** based models: 
          
          decision tree
          
          random forest
          
          gradient boosting
      
      *  **ensemble** modeling: 
          
          Voting Classifier (Gradient Boosting + Logistic Regression)
          
          Poorman Stacking
      
          Weighted Ensemble Model

+ #### Text Classification Project:
   * Do text classification on a dataset of complaints about traffic conditions to the city of Boston.
   
   * models:
      *  Logistic Regression classification model using a N-gram approach:
          
          Tokenization
      
          Word Normalization
          
          Restricting the Vocabulary (e.g. stop_words, Infrequent Words,Tfidf)     

      
      *  Clustering to see how well clusters that match well with some of the ground truth labels
          
          LDA
          
          NMF
          
          K-Means
